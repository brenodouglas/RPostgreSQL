Things yet to be Completed:
1. Complete the dbWriteTable part
2. Add the commands for transaction management.
3. Add hostadr to the connection string & make corresponding changes.    (Dont forget to check RCMD check) and try to add the functionality    to specify the connection parameters in any order.
4. Matching between the error messages & error codes in pg.
5. In dbGetInfo(rs), $fieldDescription[[1]]$Sclass & $fieldDescription   [[1]]$type are displaying numbers instead of words (like in           SQLite). So Correct the code.
6. Scale & nullOk are not given values yet in dbGetInfo(result_set)      because of lack of functions in pg. So Remove them or try to          hardcode the appropriate details in the code.For more details         refer to : "RS_PostgreSQL_createDataMappings".
7. Make test script & a test folder.
8. Improve the documentation & remove the examples from don't run        mode.
9. Just verify whether all the key words are included in the reserved    keywords section.
10.Add the mappings for all the datatypes in RS-PostgreSQL.h
11.Check whether it works in windows or not & make corresponding         changes.
12.Check whether all the data mappings are working perfectly fine &      finetune some datatypes like date,blogs etc..For checking, perform    this test. Try to convert a data to & fo via R & pg and see whether   datatype is being preserved.
13.In RS_PostgreSQL_connectionInfo, you are assigning threadid to        processid. So Check that.
14.Add comments to the code & some extra files for information sake as   in RMySQL & RSQLite.
