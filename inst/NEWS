    o   dbWriteTable writes data.frame to database through 
        network connection
        Note row_names may further changed in future releases.
        Passing filenames instead of data.frame is not managed 
        at this time.

    o   Connect to postgresql server via UNIX domain socket 
        when no host is specified

    o   Table and column names are case sensitive
        Identifiers are escaped or quoted appropriately,
        so that any table/column names can be created,
        searched, or removed.

    o   nullOk in dbColumnInfo return value is NA when 
        the column does not correspond to a column in table
        The utility of nullOk is doubtful but not removed at this time.
