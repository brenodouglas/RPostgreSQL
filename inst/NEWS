Version 0.1-7 -- 2010-10-17

    o   Several potential buffer overruns were fixed

    o   dbWriteTable now writes a data.frame to database through a network
        connection rather than a temporary file. Note that row_names may be
        changed in future releases.  Also, passing in filenames instead of
        data.frame is not supported at this time. 

    o   When no host is specified, a connection to the PostgreSQL server 
        is made via UNIX domain socket (just like psql does)

    o   Table and column names are case sensitive, and identifiers are escaped
        or quoted appropriately, so that any form of table/column names can be
        created, searched, or removed, including upper-, lower- and mixed-case.

    o   nullOk in dbColumnInfo has a return value of NA when the column does
        not correspond to a column in the table. The utility of nullOk is
        doubtful but not removed at this time.

    o   Correct Windows getpid() declaration (with thanks to Brian D. Ripley)

    o   A call of as.POSIXct() with a time format string wrongly passed to TZ
        has been corrected; this should help with intra-day timestamps (with
        thanks to Steve Eick)

    o   Usage of tmpdir has been improved on similarly to Linux (with thanks
        to Robert McGehee)

Version 0.1-6 -- 2009-10-19

    o   Added missing paste() call to dbGetQuery() for dbListTables

Version 0.1-5 -- 2009-10-13

    o   Four issues reported at the Issue tracker at the Google Code site
        are addressed, two more are feature requests and one cannot be
        replicated

    o   A number of other small fixes and enhancements to code and
        documentation as detailed in the ChangeLog file
